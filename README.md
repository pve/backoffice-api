# Backoffice

Backoffice functions, such as analytics: teachable &amp; AR scripts

Use: 
```python checkprovisioning.py```

## Developer workflow

Clone the repo in a folder, and set up a Python virtual environment. In VSCode this is "Python: Create Environment", which will also pip install the requirements.

Fill `.env` with a valid TEACHABLE_API_KEY.

Run in debugger, or `python teachableapi.py`.

Run tests with `pytest` ?
